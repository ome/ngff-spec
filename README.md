# OME-NGFF file format specification

NGFF is an initiative by the bioimaging community to develop imaging format specifications to
address issues of scalability and interoperability.

This repository contains the central [specification text](./ngff_spec/specification.md),
a comprehensive list of [metadata examples](./ngff_spec/examples)
as well as [json schemas](./ngff_spec/schemas) to validate written ome-zarr image data.
