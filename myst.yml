      abstract: >-
        A growing community is constructing a next-generation file
        format (NGFF) for bioimaging to overcome problems of
        scalability and heterogeneity. Organized by the Open
        Microscopy Environment (OME), individuals and institutes
        across diverse modalities facing these problems have
        designed a format specification process (OME-NGFF) to
        address these needs. Those community members have built
        the format itself – OME-Zarr – along with tools and data
        resources available today to increase FAIR access and
        remove barriers in the scientific process. The current
        momentum offers an opportunity to unify a key component of
        the bioimaging domain — the file format that underlies so
        many personal, institutional, and global data management
        and analysis tasks.
