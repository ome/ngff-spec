# Contribution guide

Contributions to the spec text, examples and schemas are highly welcome
and appreciated by the ngff community.
If you propose an RFC (i.e., major change) or a a minor change (pull request),
please make sure to follow [these guidelines](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/contributing/index.html).

Major changes should follow the RFC process as it was laid out in [RFC1](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/rfc/1/index.html).

## Building the documentation

Build and inspect changes to the documentation before submitting a PR.
To do so, you first need to install the necessary dependecies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This document uses [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org) to generate the pages
and [MyST](https://mystmd.org) markdown for formatting.
After installing these via the dependencies,
navigate into the repository on your machine and build the book using the following command:

```bash
python pre_build.py
jupyter-book build .
```

You'll find the built webpages under `_build/html`.

### Formating hints

The specification uses MyST extensively for a number of formatting options
to make the text readible and improve structure.

#### Referencing

MyST allows a number of ways to reference and cross-reference inside this text
and across several of the pages in this repo.
For an overview of supported referencing syntax,
see the [MyST doc pages](https://mystmd.org/guide/cross-references).
It is recommended to use the following syntax in this document for consitency:

```
anchor: (your-reference-name)=
reference: [This is a reference](your-reference-name)
```

#### Admonitions

We suggest using [admonitions](https://mystmd.org/guide/admonitions) for example code and other highlighting.
For examples, please use the following syntax to highlight your examples:

`````markdown
````{admonition} Example

Some informative text about your example
```json
"key": "value"
```
````
`````

which results in

````{admonition} Example

Some informative text about your example
```json
"key": "value"
```
````

If you want to link in example metadata from somewhere in this repo (i.e, a json file),
use this syntax:

`````markdown
````{admonition} Example

Some informative text about your example
```{literalinclude} path/to/example.json
:language: json
```
````
`````

Other useful admonitions (e.g., `hint`, `note`) can be found [here](https://mystmd.org/guide/directives).
